## project learnings
  ### 1) DOM (Document Object Model)
  Document Object model (DOM) is a modular structure created when the web page is loaded
  
  ### Let see How DOM is formed
   Whenever a **HTML**(Hyper Text Markup language) page in loaded in the browser the certain events takes place synchronously
  * HTML is recived
  * HTML is converted into tokens
  * tokens are cnverted into Nodes
  * Nodes forms the DOM
  
  The above process executes as follows:
  Whenever a HTML page is given to the browser the HTML is parsed means the HTML tags like <!DOCTYPE> ,h1, body, head, etc. are converted into tokens with the help of tokeniser. Once the HTML is converted into Tokens then these tokens are converted into nodes and then connecting these nodes forms a tree like structure called the Document object Model or DOM.
  
  The DOM is not:
* part of the JavaScript language

 The DOM is:
* constructed from the browser
* is globally accessible by JavaScript code using the document object
